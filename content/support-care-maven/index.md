**Open Elements** has launched a major initiative with its program **Support & Care for Apache Maven™**, helping to secure
a central tool of the Java ecosystem.
With funding from the [Sovereign Tech Agency](https://www.sovereign.tech/de), sustainable support for
[Apache Maven]({{< relref "articles/what-is-maven" >}}) is enabled for the first time—one of the world’s most widely
used open-source projects.

We now offer companies and organizations the opportunity to participate in this important undertaking.
By subscribing to a **Support & Care subscription**, you contribute to securing the long-term stability and continued
development of Apache Maven.
Your support helps finance critical tasks such as security updates, bug fixes, and the development of new features.

In addition to supporting community-driven development, a **Support & Care subscription** allows you to directly access
our experts and maintainers to prioritize bug fixes or assist you with other topics related to Apache Maven™.

## Our Subscription Model for Apache Maven™

We offer three different packages tailored to the needs of various user groups.
We are happy to help you determine which package best suits your requirements.

<p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">We look forward to shaping the future of Apache Maven together with you!</p>

## Support from the Sovereign Tech Agency

The Sovereign Tech Agency (STA) is a funding program of the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action
dedicated to the sustainable support of open-source software.
The program aims to secure critical digital infrastructures in the long term and strengthen the resilience of the European technology ecosystem.
Projects funded by the STA must be of significant importance to the economy and society while following sustainable development practices.

Since 2024, the STA has been investing in the Support & Care for Apache Maven™ project, enabling sustainable cost-sharing
between public funding and commercial contributions.
The STA’s investment lays the foundation for a sustainable future of the project and the entire Java ecosystem.
However, broad support from the community and industry is essential to secure Apache Maven in the long term.

## Who Works on Support & Care for Apache Maven™?

Employees of Open Elements as well as external developers and maintainers work together on Support & Care for Apache Maven™.
While project management and coordination are handled by Open Elements, development is carried out by both our engineers
and long-standing external maintainers of Apache Maven.
This close collaboration with the Apache Software Foundation and the active Apache Maven community ensures that the
project evolves in line with user needs.

## A Model Project for Open Source

With Support & Care for Apache Maven™, Open Elements is taking a strong step toward sustainable support for open-source projects.
This program serves as a pilot within the Support & Care initiative, which aims to invest in additional critical open-source components.

The concept combines public funding, commercial support, transparent financial management, and active community involvement.
It demonstrates how essential open-source projects can be made future-proof while fostering innovation — a model that
can inspire similar initiatives across the open-source ecosystem.
