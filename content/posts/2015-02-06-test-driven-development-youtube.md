[Sven Ruppert](https://twitter.com/SvenRuppert) and I gave a talk about Testing for JavaFX at [Coding Serbia](http://codingserbia.com). In this talk we show how you can test your JavaFX application by using [TestFX](https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX) and describe some patterns that are very useful when testing big applications. A detailed blog post about the topic of the talk can be found [here](/posts/2014-10-01-dialog-objects-pattern-automated-tests-testfx). The talk was recorded and published at YouTube:
